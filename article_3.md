# Creative Pursuit
 - My creative pursuit have been crocheting. 

 - With the pandemic I had taught myself how to crochet and make things with yarn.  

 - I quickly realized that this creative pursuit was going to be an expensive one, but I truly enjoy it. 

 - It is always exciting to see your creation come to life.
