# Traveling Ontario
 - As someone who does not want to travel via airplane.

 - I have been exploring Ontario's parks which has been an incredible journey for me. 

 - I have been to Thousand Islands region.

 - The beauty of the islands scattered across the St. Lawrence River, each with its own character and story.

 - I'm reminded of the profound beauty that can be found in our own backyard.
