# Going back to school 
 - When we last spoke, I was perusing my degree in Chemistry at Wilfrid Laurier. 
 - Now I am pursuing a degree in User Experience. 
 - With a chemistry degree in hand, I had spent years carefully researching chemical processes and running experiments in a lab setting. 
 - However, my desire to interact with people and have a real impact on the world through technology progressively pushed me in the direction of a career change.
