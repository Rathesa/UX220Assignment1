# Student Academic Goals
My two academic goals are to improve my GPA and engage more actively in class. I was able to compare and contrast my goals to the study's goals after reading the article "Multiple Social and Academic Achievement Goals: Students' Goal Profiles and Their Linkages." To begin, GPA improvement is divided into two categories: mastery goals and performance goals (Bardach et al. 2022). Setting performance goals each week will improve my study habits, leading in an improvement in my GPA. Furthermore, this article highlighted social goals, which link to my goal of actively participating in class. The article explains how social development objectives might support academic objectives.While actively participating in class is primarily an academic goal, it can have an indirect impact on your social life by enhancing your involvement and relationships with peers and teachers, potentially leading to a sense of belonging.
